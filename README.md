## Tech Stack

**Client:** React+Vite, TailwindCSS, javaScript

**Server:** Node, Express, mongoDB

## Features Implemented

- [x]  Login, Signup and logout
- [x]  Card View and list View
- [x]  Edit Books
- [x]  Add New Books
- [x]  Delete Book
- [x]  View book

## Design Decisions
- Frontend using react and tailwind since i needed to have same components and react helps in that and tailwind has very good documentation.

- backend node.js and express.js framework.

- database - used online cloud nosql database mongodb for scalabilty and ease of storing and querying.

## Challenges Faced

- Using async requests using axios .
- cross domain request policy for the different domains to send request to server.
- tailwind css for the card view.
